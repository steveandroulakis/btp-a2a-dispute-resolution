# Dispute Resolution with Multi-Agent Orchestration
[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/btp-a2a-dispute-resolution)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/btp-a2a-dispute-resolution)

> [!NOTE]
> **Experimental**: The current source code and architecture are experimental, intended for research and proof-of-concept purposes, and are subject to change.

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end scenario where multiple organizations collaborate through domain-specific AI agents to resolve a customer dispute.
The agents use an open [Agent-to-Agent (A2A)](https://github.com/google/A2A) communication protocol and [Open Resource Discovery (ORD)](https://github.com/open-resource-discovery/specification) to dynamically discover each other's capabilities and collaborate on complex tasks that exceed the scope of a single agent.

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](./docs/architecture.svg)
> [!NOTE]
> This architecture illustrates AI agents integrated via point-to-point connections, as currently implemented. Alternatively, a centralized orchestrator per platform could be introduced.

## Scenario

XStore disputes an invoice from Cymbal Direct after receiving a short shipment of 900 t-shirts instead of the expected 1,000. Vicky, an employee of Cymbal Direct, uses **Joule** to resolve the issue with the help of several backend agents representing different organizations and capabilities.

Watch the demo video to see the scenario in action:

[![Watch the video](./docs/img/demo.png)](https://sapvideo.cfapps.eu10-004.hana.ondemand.com/?entry_id=1_kcgq0nd4)

### Scenario Breakdown

- **User Prompt**: Vicky reports a shipment discrepancy via Joule.
- **Joule as Orchestrator Agent Planning**:
  - Identifies required agents from the Agent Catalog.
  - Creates a task plan for orchestration.
- **Agent Orchestration**:
  - **Dispute Resolution Agent, mocked (SAP)**: Confirms invoice and shipment data from SAP S/4HANA; expected 1,000 units.
  - **Warehouse Insights Agent (Google)**: Analyzes logistics and retrieves a packaging slip showing only 900 t-shirts shipped.
  - **Dispute Policy & Email Agent (Microsoft)**: Retrieves communication logs and creates an email draft to the customer according to the dispute policy.
- **Response to User**:
  - Confirmation of dispute resolution creation and customer email.

## Repository Structure
### [agent-catalog](/agent-catalog/): Agent discovery and routing services 
  - `ord-aggregator`: Acts as `AGENT_CATALOG`, aggregates Agent Cards across catalogs (SAP, GCP, Azure) using ORD.
  - `a2a-router`: Acts as `AGENT_ROUTER` which connects to `ord-aggregator` and routes requests to appropriate agents using A2A protocol (A2A Client)

### [agents](/agents/): A2A agents on SAP, GCP and Azure
  - [sap-agent-builder-a2a](/agents/sap-agent-builder-a2a/)
      - agent-builder-a2a-agent-conntector: CAP application that wraps an Agent running on Agent Builder (SAP BTP) to enable A2A and exposing its Agent Card via Open Resource Discovery (ORD). 
      - agent-builder-agent-exports: Exported agents from BAF
          - `orchestrator`: Joule's main entry point for the scenario
          - `dispute-resolution-agent`: Agent running on Agent Builder (SAP BTP) that handles dispute resolution.
  - [gcp-adk-a2a](/agents/gcp-adk-a2a/): Agent deployed on GCP based on A2A and exposed Agent Card via Open Resource Discovery (ORD).
      - `warehouse-insights-agent`: Tracks stock movements across the warehouse and their causes in real-time.
  - [azure-ai-foundry-a2a](/agents/azure-ai-foundry-a2a/): Agent deployed on Azure based on A2A and exposed Agent Card via Open Resource Discovery (ORD).
      - `dispute-email-agent`: Agent that creates email drafts according to specific dispute policies for dispute resolution.
